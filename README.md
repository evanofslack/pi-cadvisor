# pi-cadvisor
Docker image for running [Cadvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor) on Raspberry Pi OS lite 64-bit.

This docker image and compose file are a workaround for errors encountered when running on Raspi-64 bit. See [this thread](https://github.com/google/cadvisor/issues/3011) for details.
